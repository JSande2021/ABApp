**Setting up the IDE for the Application**
- The first step to getting this application running on your system is to first import the project
into eclipse or your favorite IDE. This can be easily done by downloading the GitHub Desktop Application and cloning the repository after you have been granted access to the repository with the following link: https://github.com/JSande2021/AddressBook2

- Once you have the GitHub Desktop Application downloaded and you're signed in, you can clone a repository with the previous link and them open this prroject through your favorite IDE. The one utilized to create the project was Eclipse, so this one will be preferred to avoid any unnecessary issues with opening and running the application.
